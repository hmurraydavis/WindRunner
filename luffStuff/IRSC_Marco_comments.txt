Ehy Halie, don't take these comments as ''personal'' or rude, I just wrote things that came into my mind while I was reading it ... keep on the excellent work ;)

1) Reading senors: have you considered using wheatstone bridge (if you use two sensors of the same kind)?

2) Plots: after reading the papaer, maybe (again, maybe) I would have put in the same plot the same measurements, taken from the two differente case of study. (ask me if this sentence is not clear, as it is likely)

3) Fig 11 : I think it's quite a mess. Male people can barely recognize 7 colors, and if you put two shades of purple in the same plot and I print it to read it on a real piece of paper, I would probably print it in black&white ... I would split the main plot in subplots, forexaple as done in Matlab using the subplot() function ...
    4 vertically stacked subplots
